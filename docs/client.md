# Client Guide

The Jean2 server exposes a REST API and WebSocket endpoint. Any client that speaks these protocols can connect. Here are the official options.

## Built-in Client

The server automatically downloads and serves the latest client from npm on port **3774** (configurable via `JEAN2_CLIENT_PORT`) when running. This is the recommended way to connect:

```bash
jean2 start
jean2 open
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3774` in your browser.

## PWA (any device)

The web client is a Progressive Web App. Open it once in your browser, and it's available offline:

- **Desktop**: Click the install icon in the address bar
- **iOS**: Tap Share → Add to Home Screen
- **Android**: Tap the install banner or menu → Add to Home Screen

The PWA caches assets locally and works even without an internet connection to the client CDN. (You still need a connection to your Jean2 server.)

## Desktop App (macOS)

The Electron desktop app provides a native experience with system tray, notifications, and auto-updates. Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jean2ai/jean2/releases), install, and launch it. It connects to the server on port **8742** (configurable via `JEAN2_PORT`).

## Browser Extension

The [Jean2Browser](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jean2browser/jpahdfmmfmmnacapmkchljmcijoedcpj) extension lets the agent control a Chrome browser: navigate pages, read content, and click elements. Install it from the Chrome Web Store, then connect it to your Jean2 server from the extension popup.

## Connecting to a Remote Server

The client opens a connection finder automatically. You can also:

1. Click the server switcher in the sidebar
2. Enter the server URL (e.g., `https://my-vps.example.com:8742`)
3. If auth is enabled, enter the token

Jean2 works over:
- **Local network**: `http://192.168.1.x:8742`
- **Tailscale / VPN**: `http://jean2-server:8742`
- **Public internet**: requires TLS and auth. Set up a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) with HTTPS, then point the client at the domain.
